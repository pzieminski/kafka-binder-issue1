=== Running the app

Go to the root of the repository.

Make sure you have Kafka broker running. The application expects it to be on defaults (localhost:9092). If thats not the case, change the configuration.

`./mvnw clean package`

Start the application in an IDE using
`-Dspring.profiles.active=foo,baz_ok`
Note the app starts successfully.

Re-run the application with
`-Dspring.profiles.active=foo,baz_fail`
Note the exception thrown

    `java.lang.IllegalStateException: The binder 'kafka1' cannot bind a com.sun.proxy.$Proxy68`

Also, if the binder name is commented out as shown in `src/main/resources/application.alternate.yml`, the application start-up succeeds in both cases.
